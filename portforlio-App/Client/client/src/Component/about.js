    Driven by a passion for technology and a strong analytical mindset, I am a Computer Science major at the University of Winnipeg, complemented by a minor in Economics and Finance. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in full-stack development, cybersecurity principles, and data analysis techniques. I'm eager to apply this knowledge to create impactful solutions and contribute to innovative teams.

Throughout my studies and hands-on projects, I've honed my technical skills in languages like Python and SQL, enabling me to effectively analyze and interpret complex datasets. My coursework has delved into fascinating areas such as machine learning, data structures, and optimization, which I've brought to life through practical applications.
<br />
Some of the projects I've tackled include:
<br />
<strong>AI-Powered Phishing Email Detection:</strong> Developing a machine learning model using Natural Language Processing to accurately identify malicious emails.
<strong>Malware Analysis Platform:</strong> Constructing a containerized system leveraging YARA rules and hashlib for robust malware detection.
<strong>Relational and NoSQL Database Projects:</strong> Designing and optimizing database schemas in PostgreSQL and MongoDB to enhance data retrieval efficiency for various applications.
<strong>Node.js Library Application: </strong>Building a full-stack application with secure user authentication, utilizing RESTful APIs and MongoDB for encrypted password storage.
Beyond the technical realm, I thrive on problem-solving and possess a knack for translating intricate analyses into clear, actionable insights.I value collaboration and effective communication, ensuring that technical complexities are understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

I am a highly motivated and adaptable individual, always eager to learn and grow. I am excited by opportunities that allow me to contribute my analytical skills and programming expertise to real-world challenges, while continuously expanding my knowledge under the guidance of experienced professionals.<br />
