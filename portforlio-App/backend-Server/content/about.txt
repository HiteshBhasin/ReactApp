About Me

Hi, I'm **Hitesh Bhasin**, a passionate and driven software developer with a solid academic foundation in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Economics and Finance** from the **University of Winnipeg**. My journey into tech has been fueled by a deep curiosity for how things work, a love for problem-solving, and a desire to build impactful digital solutions.

Over the past few years, I've developed a diverse skill set through hands-on coursework and personal projects, mastering languages such as **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **C#**, and building proficiency in technologies like **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **React**. I'm comfortable working across both frontend and backend, and I enjoy transforming real-world problems into smart, scalable solutions.

Key Projects

- **📚 Library Management System**  
  A full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It streamlines book checkouts, returns, and inventory tracking, with a clean UI and optimized backend functionality.

- **📈 Stock Prediction Tool**  
  Developed a predictive model using Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) to analyze historical stock data and forecast future trends. This project honed my understanding of machine learning and data science techniques.

- **🎮 Game Development in Unity**  
  Designed and developed an interactive game using Unity and C#. Integrated animations, audio, and smooth mechanics to enhance the gaming experience while practicing modular code design and cross-platform deployment.

- **⭕ Tic Tac Toe in Java**  
  A console-based game built to reinforce OOP concepts and Java fundamentals.

Each of these projects reflects my ability to learn fast, think critically, and apply technical knowledge to build real applications.

🏆 Notable Achievement

I had the honor of representing the **University of Winnipeg** at the prestigious **JDC West** competition as a **Business Technology Delegate**. Working in a competitive, team-based environment sharpened my skills in strategic thinking, professional communication, and applying technology to real-world business problems.
